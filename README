Implement doubly-linked list.

Macros list_each() and list_each_backward() have a shadow iterator,
so for instance it is safe to write

  struct mystruct
  {
    ...
    struct list_node mynode;
    ...
  };
  struct mystruct *mylist;

  ...

  for (struct mystruct *list_each(it, mylist, mynode))
    free(it);

i.e. to modify *it in any way as it won't be referenced again during
traversal.

Defining KROKI_LIST_NOPOLLUTE will result in omitting alias
definitions, but functionality will still be available with the
namespace prefix 'kroki_'.
